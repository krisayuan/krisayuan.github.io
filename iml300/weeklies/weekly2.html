		<h1>California Utopianism: All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace</h1>
		<h2>how was the internet shaped by objectivism?</h2>
		<p>The first episode of All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace ties in the economic success of early Silicon Valley and the dot-com boom with the philosophies of Ayn Rand. Interviews with old Silicon Valley executives show the clear connections between the missions of their startups, which would later become big companies like Pixar, and the single-minded self-actualization of Objectivism. The internet, at its inception, was sort of like a utopia, or at least it had the potential to be one. Many people today probably imagine what the world could be like if we could go back in time and redo everything, knowing all that we know now about technology, science, philosophy, and government. With the creation of the new digital world, this was possible, and because of Rand’s influence, it took on a distinctly Objectivist atmosphere. A new universe not bound by the physical constraints of reality, ruled by no party and patrolled by no police, Rand’s, “his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute” philosophy would be easy to achieve. The commercial nature of internet services also lended themselves to Objectivism. Keeping people online longer meant that these companies would earn more money, therefore, it would be better for people to be able to do what they wanted. Furthermore, the newness of the internet proved that concepts like altruism, which Rand vehemently rejected, calling altruists “whim-worshippers”were not possible in many online spaces. What would kindness or self-sacrifice online look like? The very act of going online and doing what you wished was in line with Ayn Rand’s beliefs.</p>
