	<h1>diagrams/arakawa: the mechanisms of meaning</h1>
	<h2>what is the difference between diagrams for art and non art?</h2>
	<p>I would say diagrams for non art are meant to convey information with as much ease as possible so that the viewer may receive and understand the information. Diagrams for art are not held to the same obligations because they are not tools for human understanding so they can be abstract or require longer contemplation to interpret. However, while this explanation first made sense to me, it is often disproved in the current diagram landscape. Taking a look at diagrams designed for political agendas, information is often obscured or just designed to be deceiving because the designer or whoever was the boss of the designer wanted it to be that way. Similarly, art diagrams, while art, are not devoid of meaning and ideology as art is created by the artist (hopefully) for a reason. In The Mechanisms of Meaning, Arakawa and Gins’ 8.1 Reassembling clearly conveys some rules of basic color theory, alphabetical order, and visual addition. The first row shows a red A and blue B combining to create a purple C. Although it is most definitely made to be art, it has a more base function which shows how entities combine to form an end product that is the sum of their original parts. Furthermore, the functions of a diagram are not the only defining factor of non art or art, as from plays a role as well. If I see a diagram about celery consumption at a bus stop that’s well designed in terms of color, font choice, or information organization, I would consider it art. Though the intent of the diagram was not become art, a good designer would still employ the widely accepted rules of design in their diagram, injecting artistic intent into it nonetheless. Art and non art are not mutually exclusive categories of diagrams and many diagrams are both.
