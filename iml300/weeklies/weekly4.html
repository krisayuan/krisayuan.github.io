	<h1>Cybernetics: All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace</h1>
	<h2>Do you think humans can be understood through cybernetics?</h2>
	<br>
	<p>The second episode of All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace is titled, “The Use of Abuse of Vegetational Concepts” and I think that is pretty descriptive of the application of cybernetics in human culture and society. The idea of the self-correcting system was applied in multiple ways in the episode, from communes to architectural structures, and yet I feel none of them grasp the actual repercussions of the implementation of cybernetics on a global scale.. Richard Brautigan’s cybernetics manifesto wrote of a world “held in a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of nature and computers,” and yet I think these early ideas of cybernetics fail to recognize that humans may not be a part of the equilibrium. Not to presume the robot takeover and apocalypse, but people routinely mess up the Earth in irreparable ways. It may have been less noticeable and less urgent in the 20th century, but we are killing the planet 24/7. If this self self-stabilizing system were to be implemented, if a harmonious relationship between the ecosystem and technology were to be established, the stability of the system would be prioritized. And who messes up the balance of life in nature? Humans! All the time! And yet, the obsession with the merger of natural and synthetic systems persist. One such cybernetics renaissance I have observed in more recent generations is the push towards “solarpunk” aesthetics. It’s name derives from a celebration of the anarchist nature of the fusion of plant matter and society, highlighting the Earth’s disregard for human structures. I for one welcome our plant-bot overlords, but the vaguely cult-recruitment like mood of the video makes me concerned about the thought people have put behind locking ourselves into a system.</p>
