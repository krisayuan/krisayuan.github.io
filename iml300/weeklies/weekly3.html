	<h1>Internet Art: Hito Steyerl: In Defense of the Poor Image</h1>
	<h2>what is the political value of the poor image?</h2>
	<p>
		Accessibility has always been one of the core parts of much of leftist theory and activism. Whether it is the need for the accessibility to the means of production like Marx outlined, or the literal need for infrastructure that is accessible to disabled, mentally ill, and poor people. Hito Steyerl’s In Defense of the Poor Image, she explains the inherent political value of the poor image, an image whose low resolution, shakiness, or graininess allow it to be accessible. In spaces like film, where beautiful high quality shots are considered the norm, the replication of it’s content through illicit filming and bad torrents removes not only the quality of the image but the classist barriers of it as well. The poor image does not care about the origins of the rich image, because it can degrade and degrade further the original; therefore, the privatization and commercialization of the media we consume is further degraded. By circumventing the physical barriers that prevent the sharing of the image like closed screenings and gallery showings, the digitality of the poor image “strives to overcome the divisions of labor within class society...It insists upon its own imperfection, is popular but not consumerist, committed without becoming bureaucratic.” (Steyerl 39) With the growth of the rich image in places where it was once impossible to create on websites like Youtube (many creators now have profession HD cameras that cost thousands of dollars) and even on phones (new iPhones have 8 megapixel cameras), the poor image goes directly against capitalist structures urging us to participate in the creation of the rich image. The popularity of deep-fried memes and jpg-upon-jpg screenshots of photos with a younger generation that is also more casually progressive than before, shows that by losing quality the image “recovers some of its political punch and creates a new aura around it. This aura is no longer based on the permanence of the “original,” but on the transience of the copy.” (Steyerl, 43)
