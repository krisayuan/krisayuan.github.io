	<h2>Grave Men, Near Death</h2>
	<p>Three young men entangle themselves in the drug trade to pay for college. Their success and greed progresses until they eventually get caught up in the dangerous realm of corporate espionage. This gripping movie is chock-full of violence, robbery, drug dealing, and a plethora of other dissolute behaviors. The main character, Benjamin Michaels, does whatever it takes for him and his new family's dreams to come to fruition. The movie examines the very essence of morality in the real-life modern world pitting one value against another. Benny does what he has to do to survive in a culture driven by monetary interests.</p>
